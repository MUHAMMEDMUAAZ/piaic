    <h3>PRESIDENTIAL INITIATIVE FOR ARTIFICAL INTELLIGENCE AND COMPUTING</h3>
    <p>Presidential Initiative for Artificial Intelligence and Computing (PIAIC) is a privately funded not-for-profit educational initiative started by President of Pakistan, Dr. Arif Alvi, Kazi Rahat Ali, and Zia Khan to help promote education, research and business opportunities in emerging tech fields like</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Cloud Native Computing</li>
        <li>Artifical Intelligence</li>
        <li>Blockchain</li>
        <li>Internet Of Things</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><span class="a">C</span>loud Native Computing:</h2>
    <p>Cloud native computing is an approach in software development that utilizes cloud computing to its fullest due to its use of an open source software stack to deploy applications as microservices.Typically, cloud native applications are built as a set of microservices that run in Docker containers, orchestrated in Kubernetes and managed and deployed using DevOps and Git Ops workflows.The advantage of using Docker containers is the ability to package all software needed to execute into one executable package. The container runs in a virtualized environment, which isolates the contained application from its environment.</p>

    <h2><span class="a">A</span>rtifical Intelligence:</h2>
    <p>In computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), sometimes called machine intelligence, is intelligence demonstrated by machines, in contrast to the natural intelligence displayed by humans. Leading AI textbooks define the field as the study of "intelligent agents": any device that perceives its environment and takes actions that maximize its chance of successfully achieving its goals.Colloquially, the term "artificial intelligence" is often used to describe machines (or computers) that mimic "cognitive" functions that humans associate with the human mind, such as "learning" and "problem solving".</p>

    <h2><span class="a">B</span>lockchain:</h2>
    <p>A blockchain,originally block chain,is a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).</p>

    <h2><span class="a">I</span>nternet Of Things:</h2>
    <p>The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction</p>
